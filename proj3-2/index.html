            Overview: This project dealt with more complicated raytracing topics. Specifically, I worked on part 1 and 4, which handles mirror/glass
            materials and camera depth of field, respectively. Honestly, the spec explained what to do fairly well so there weren't many
            problems on my end. There were a few parts I misunderstood, such as how to use the reflect and refract functions, but other than
            that it was pretty straight forward.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary, Explanation, Comparisons</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Essentially for this part of hw 3-2, I implemented the functions required to perform ray tracing on mirror and glass
                    materials. What that really boils down to, is that rays need to be able to be reflected (mirror) and also refracted/bent
                    (glass) just as they are in real life. There are some approximations we make. Specifically for glass, we approximate
                    the Fresnel coefficient with Schlick's approximation, which is far easier to compute, but less realistic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I further explain why my images look the way they do below, but generally it has to do with bounces and warping of
                    light. Specifically, the left sphere is one bounce behind the rest of the scene, since it's reflecting the scene around
                    it. The right sphere is warping the light rays.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Show a sequence of six images of scene CBspheres.dae rendered with max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should be at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light.</li>

                    The left sphere is reflecting light and shows us what it would look like if
                    the camera was instead placed where the sphere was. We can see the black void that the camera side of the box opens up to.
                    The right sphere is refracting the light going through it, which explains why it looks different from the left sphere.

                <li>
                    One way to think about what's being seen is that
                    the view on the sphere is one "step" behind, in that it requires an extra bounce to reflect what we see in the rest
                    of the scene. This is because the surface of the spheres count as one bounce. Specifically, look at the 2 bounce image.
                    The ceiling is unlit within on the surface of the sphere, just as it was in the 1 bounce image.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Essentially for this part of hw 3-2, I implemented a way for rays to pass through a circular lens before reaching
                the scene. The rays are randomly sampled in this lens and allows for rays to be bent through it. This means light from
                the scene has more ways to "reach" the pixels for the image displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
                As I increase the focal distance, the more "accurate" the rays bent through the lens become for objects further away.
                This is because, with a short focal distance, the "blue" (according to the spec) bent ray hits a completely different
                point than the "red" ray when tracing all the way to a further (or much closer) object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aperture size affects how many possible different rays can be bent through through the lens. As I increase aperture
                size, more world surface area can contribute to the pixels in the image. This causes a bluriness seen in the images
                below.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If I understand it all correctly, a pinhole camera only lets light into the camera at a single point.</li>
                <li>
                    A thin-lens camera model instead allows light into the camera through a circle (the lens). This means more rays are
                    able to enter the camera, so we're able to get a picture that includes more ways light can reach the camera. Practically,
                    this means that objects in focus are seen/rendered as normal, but objects further or closer than the focal distance appear
                    blurry. I believe this is due to the way a lens bends light and causes the out-of-focus objects to spread their light rays
                    over a larger area, instead of them all going to a smaller area with a smaller aperture.
