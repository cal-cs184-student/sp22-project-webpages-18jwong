        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>This project essentially covers everything you need to know to replicate Half-Life: Alyx's liquid in bottles shaders.
        I implemented a cloth simulation made up of a grid of point masses and springs. This cloth can accurately collide with 
        other objects, as well as itself. Finally, the project also goes into GPU shaders through GLSL. They allow for quick
        calculations regarding the coloring of pixels on your screen due to objects in the scene. There are tons of directions to go in 
        with shaders. I implemented mirrors, textures, and Blinn-Phong shading. My biggest take away from this project is that
        it's actually not as complicated to simulate cloths and write shaders as I thought it previously was. Although they're not
        easy, it really is possible for someone like me to recreate the realistic shader effects present in Half-Life: Alyx.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs.</i></li>
            <li><i>Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</i></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Essentially what I did for this part was create a grid of points based on given parameters and connect them in certain ways
                    with springs. Structural springs are connected to the left, right, up, and down. Shearing springs are connected diagonally.
                    Bending springs are connected to the left, right, up, and down, but 2 points away instead of 1, though this is hard to
                    visually demonstrate since they overlap.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R.</i></li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?</i></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Increasing the spring constant ks increases the stiffness of the cloth and its resistance to changing its shape.
                        With a low ks, the cloth acts much like a loosely connected chainmail and loses its shape very easily, only being
                        connected by the springs between points. With a high ks, the distances between point masses are kept much more
                        strictly. It falls just as quickly, but the shape of the cloth stays much more stiff, more like paper.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Increasing density reduces the relative strength the springs. A much higher density causes the springs to stretch
                        more and the cloth to be very flat. A low density allows the creases at the top to stick further out, as we'd expect
                        from a real cloth.
                    </li>

                </div>
                <li><i>What about for damping?</i></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Damping also has a large effect on the cloth's resistance to changing its shape. Increasing damping increases the
                        simulated friction and also its resistance to bending. A high damping percentage looks as if we've slowed down time and
                        the cloth is very large/has a lot of air resistance. A low damping percentage allows the cloth the bounce around much more
                        easily, as the bending springs have less affect and less hold on retaining the original shape of the cloth. I think the
                        difference between changing damping and ks is that damping only effects the bending springs, but ks affects all springs.
                        This means that changing ks also affects compression of the cloth, as opposed to just pulling it apart.

                <li>
                    As expected, a weaker spring constant <i>ks</i> results in a more flexible cloth that can more easily drape
                    over the sphere. A stronger spring constatn results in a stiffer, but paper like cloth.

                <li>The high density, low ks images don't look very realistic and I'm unsure if this is because of my code or the

                <li>Both a high density and a low ks would result in something similar to what we're seeing in my images. A high density
                would cause more gravitational pull on each point mass, so the cloth would have more trouble holding its shape. Likewise
                when we have a low ks, the springs will have a harder time resisting gravity and cave on itself. Why it caves in such a
                weird shape is beyond me though. Likely due to the random z initialization we did in part 1, but my results are
                pretty consistent in shape when repeated, so maybe not.</li>
                <li>Both the low density and the high ks cloth very easily fold into a nice pattern. That's probably due to the
                lowered required resistance due to density and the increased resistance from the springs, respectively. This
                allows the cloth to retain its shape better.</li>

                    A shader program essentially is a parallelizable set of code that can be run on GPUs to speed up the coloring of
                    pixels. Vertex shaders essentially figure out where normal vectors' positions are and where they point, and ultimately
                    change those positions too through gl_position. Vertex shaders pass information to the fragment shaders through variables
                    such as uniforms and varyings. The fragment shader then (for our purposes) are doing work to essentially figure
                    out how to color the pixels on our screens.

                    Blinn-Phong has 3 components, ambient, diffuse, and spectral. Essentially ambient is the base light applied to the
                    entire object or scene. Diffuse is light on an object that doesn't account for the viewing angle, only the light source(s)
                    angle. Spectral has to do with the shiny highlights and this does depend on the viewing angle.

You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that's not the default texture_2.png. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.</i></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The only difference between the two approaches is that displacement actually moves the vertex locations. Both attempt
                    to create a visual depth through the coloring of the pixels.
                    I think both look pretty good. It is crazy to me though, how good the displacement shader can be. I'd expect either
                    the displacements to be super inaccurate or not very prominent, but it actually looks relatively good.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I don't notice any differences in the bump shader from a courseness of 16 to 128. However, there is a noticeable
                    difference in the displacement shader. Because the courseness is higher, the displacement shader appears to be able to
                    make sharper, more complex edges.

                that I wanted to try replicating. I read the article and it's totally doable given time since it pretty much
                uses springs to simulate the liquids, but I don't really have the time right now.</li>
                <li>What I did do was, after seeing the bubbles/foam in the article, realize I could easily add noise to any shader.
                So I added a pseudorandom noise to the mirror shader just to see what would happen and I think I've stumbled on a 
                pretty solid way of creating a dirty mirror (like car side mirrors, for example). </li>
